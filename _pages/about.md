I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Finance and FinTech at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by [Prof. Jialin Yu](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=jialin-yu-jialin) and [Prof. Yingying Li](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=yingying-li-yyli). 

**I am on the 2024-2025 Ph.D. Finance Job Market, with an expected graduation date of May 2025.**
