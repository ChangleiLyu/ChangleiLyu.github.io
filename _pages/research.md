**Stock Co-jump Networks with Mixed Membership**\


<p style='text-align: justify;'>Abstract: Empirically, we find that the purity of individual stocks has a strictly monotonic relationship with both volatility and the Sharpe ratio, and the peer momentum defined by the mixed membership has a stronger network momentum effect.</p><br/>

**How to Dominate the Historical Average**\

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Abstract: We present a novel methodology for the out-of-sample forecast of the equity premium. Our approach matches the stability of the historical average while conservatively utilizing a predictorâ€™s capacity to improve forecast accuracy. We demonstrate that, theoretically and empirically, our method dominates the historical average in forecast performance. Our methodology establishes a simple yet powerful paradigm for exploiting the real-time equity premium predictability derived from a predictor. Applications of our method reveal that many predictors can forecast the equity premium, and that parameter estimates in previous studies add value to out-of-sample forecasts. </p><br/>

#**1. Do Shared Auditors Facilitate Follow-on Innovation?**\

#<p style='text-align: justify;'>Abstract: We investigate whether shared auditors promote the dissemination of innovative knowledge among their clients, thereby fostering follow-on innovation. We find that a company cites more patents from another company when they are audited by the same audit office. To address #concerns about potential confounding factors stemming from commonalities in the fundamentals of the two companies, we leverage a quasi-exogenous shock to auditor sharing: the demise of Arthur Andersen and the subsequent increase in auditor switching in 2002. Further analysis reveals that the effect of a shared auditor #on cross-client patent citations is stronger when both clients engage in intensive innovation activities and when their products exhibit greater similarity. Additional evidence suggests that shared auditors exert more influence on the citations of recent patents and patents that are easier for outsiders to utilize. #Overall, our findings suggest that auditors play a significant role in corporate innovation by facilitating the transfer of innovative knowledge among their clients.
