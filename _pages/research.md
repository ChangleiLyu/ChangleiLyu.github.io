**Stock Co-jump Networks with Mixed Membership**\
*- with Guoli Liu, Xinghua Zheng and Yingying Li, 2024*
<p style='text-align: justify;'>Abstract: We build the stock co-jump network based on the high-frequency data to study the linkage between stocks. We propose a new model to involve the stock’s mixed membership structure and develop a statistical machine learning algorithm, Mixed-SCORE-DMP. We show that Mixed-SCORE-DMP is asymptotically consistent in estimating the mixed membership structures. Empirically, we find a statistically significant co-movement in the fundamentals of mixed membership firms. The purity of individual stocks has a strictly monotonic relationship with both volatility and the Sharpe ratio, and the peer momentum defined by the mixed membership has a stronger network momentum effect.. </p><br/>

**How to Dominate the Historical Average**\
*- with Yingying Li, Kai Li and Jialin Yu, 2024, [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4245306)*\
*- [Review of Financial Studies, forthcoming]*


<p style='text-align: justify;'>Abstract: We present a novel methodology for the out-of-sample forecast of the equity premium. Our approach matches the stability of the historical average while conservatively utilizing a predictor’s capacity to improve forecast accuracy. We demonstrate that, theoretically and empirically, our method dominates the historical average in forecast performance. Our methodology establishes a simple yet powerful paradigm for exploiting the real-time equity premium predictability derived from a predictor. Applications of our method reveal that many predictors can forecast the equity premium, and that parameter estimates in previous studies add value to out-of-sample forecasts. </p><br/>
